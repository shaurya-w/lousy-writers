        Hello there! I'm Shaurya Wajge, a computer engineering student who loves trying out new things — whether it’s exploring tech, experimenting with ideas, or just following where curiosity takes me.

        You’ve probably heard the saying “curiosity killed the cat.” I like to think of it differently: curiosity keeps me moving forward. It’s what drives me to keep exploring, building, and growing.

        I hope you have a good time reading about my experiences as much as I enjoy writing about them. It's nice to have you here!
    </p>
