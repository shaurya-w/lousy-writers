-> Subject: Applied Mathematics 
Marks allocation: 125 marks (UT-1 & UT-2: 20+20, Term work: 25, End semester: 60)

-Books/References: G.V. Kumbhojkar (available in the library/online, avoid buying it). Go through the solved examples from the book and you’re good to go. Don’t go for the exercises in this book, it would be really time-consuming. For UT’s, solve the question banks that will be provided by the faculty. Personally, for end semester, we had 5-6 days study leave (since maths is the first paper) so I solved the solved examples from Kumbhojkar during that time and some PYQs. 

-> Subject: Applied Chemistry 
Marks Allocation: (UT-1 & UT-2: 15+15, Term work: 25, End semester: 45)

-Lectures: Totally up to you whether to attend (and also up to your ability to not fall asleep during a theory lecture)
-Books/References: Vandana ma'am’s notes and Techknowledge. 
-Note: All of the studying for this subject was done just days before the end semester exam because one can’t obviously retain theory for that long. Go through previous year papers to know which topics are more important and to know how the questions will be asked.

-> Subject: Applied Physics 
Marks Allocation: (UT-1 & UT-2: 15+15, Term work: 25, End semester: 45)

-Lectures: Totally up to you and your ability to not fall asleep during a theory lecture. 
-Books/References: Techneo/Techknowledge and honestly some random pdfs that will pop up on unofficial groups before the exam.  
-Note: (most of the studying for this subject was done just days before the end semester exam for better retention of theory). Go through previous year papers to know which topics are more important and to know how the questions will be asked.

-> Subject: Engineering Mechanics
Marks Allocation: 150 marks (UT-1 & UT-2: 20+20, Term work: 25, End semester: 60, Viva: 25)

-Books/References: The booklet that is provided by the college. Need to prepare that for UTs unless faculty says otherwise. For end semesters: PYQs practice. 
-Note: It is a subject where some people lose a lot of marks even after studying so practice as much as you can. This is the subject where I would advise not doing things last minute. 

-> Subject : Basic Electronic and Electrical Engineering 
Marks Allocation: 150 marks (UT-1 & UT-2: 20+20, Term work: 25, End semester: 60, Viva: 25)

-Labs/Practicals: Attend on allocated days (be as unproblematic as possible (internal KTs are a thing)) and submit journals/assignments on time. Assignments will have circuit sums so utilize those for practice. 
-Lectures: Must attend (unless you don’t understand). 
-Books/References: Ravi Singh (available in library) solved examples for AC/DC sums. Matthew sir’s notes for transformers, motors, etc. PYQs practice. 
-Note: It is a subject where some people lose a lot of marks even after studying so practice as much as you can. This is the subject where I would advise not doing things last minute. For viva, the professor/external can ask anything from the syllabus (even tricky questions so make sure your concepts are clear. You will often be given a choice: they will ask which one’s your strongest topic so you can rely on that too). 

Subject: Professional Communication and Ethics 
Marks allocation: 100 marks (Internal: 30, Term work: 25, End semester: 45)
s
-Labs/Practicals: This is where we used to be given comprehension and reading assignments. These assignments will be graded for term work. Try not to skip tutorials because end-semester submissions will become hectic. 
-Lectures: No comments :|
-Books/References: Material provided by respective faculty. 
-Note: For internals, you might have to give a speech/presentation depending on what your faculty decides. 

Subject: C Programming
-Marks allocation: 50 marks (Practical exam + viva: 25, Term work: 25)

-Practical exam: There will be a list of experiments that will be given to you from which you will be expected to execute a program on the day of the practical exam. Our faculty had chits for all the programs and you had to choose one from it. (I had gotten sorting of a structure, by the way.)
-Note: Study C properly as it will be a required prerequisite for many things that will come up in semester 2 as well as 3. As long as you keep up with the labs and practice before practical exam, we’re good to go. 

Subject: Workshop and UHV – 25 marks each (no theory exam)

In conclusion, 1st semester will be over before you know it. It felt like a short semester since CAP rounds lasted till September. `
