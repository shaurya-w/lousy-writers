I don’t know — maybe it was just me, or maybe everyone is equally giddy when they first learn to drive a car.

In my head, the idea of driving was cinematic: me on a highway, wind rushing, music blasting, adrenaline high. I wasn’t starting from zero, either. I’d been riding an Activa for a while, so I did have some experience with the road. My father himself taught me how to ride an Activa, but this time he wanted me to take formal training from a driving school since they have a car with an extra set of clutch and brake. Thus began training school.

On Day 1, the instructor gave me a quick introduction to how a car works. The most important lesson I found was that you should listen to your vehicle; it will tell you if something’s wrong or if the gears need to be changed. 

The next lesson was the pickup — I was told that the first impression you make as a new driver depends on this. Pickup means starting the car, and if you’ve ever tried balancing a light switch exactly in the middle… well, the pickup felt exactly like that. You have to release the clutch neither too slowly nor too quickly, because you’ll stall either way. Stalling is basically when your car stops abruptly (and makes you question everything). On Day 2, as instructed, I pressed the clutch and set the gear to first. I then lightly touched the accelerator and released the clutch slooooooooowly. The car started moving, and I had a wide grin on my face.
Slowly, as the days passed, we kept moving up the gears one by one. I’d come home and yap excitedly, saying things like, “I went up to the 4th gear today!” 

On the 10th day, my dad let me drive our car. He drove up to the coastal road, and then we switched places. I’m pretty sure he was tense — let’s be real, it was his first time helping someone drive while sitting in the passenger seat; his hand hovering over the handbrake every now and then, just in case. After all, they don’t cover “brand-new driver behind the wheel” as a factor in car insurance. The pickup was smooth (thank God!), and the overall drive too. It felt amazing.

But the coastal road ended — which is essentially a highway — and we returned to normal, busy roads. Now, I’m at a signal, first in line, and the light turns green. I stall. My dad says, “Okay, try again.” I do… and stall again. The signal turns red. I take a deep breath. Green again — stall again. By now, the honking behind me had reached full symphony level, and it turned into a road rage situation real quick. (This was the kind of main character moment you don’t want.) My dad and I switched places.
It was a little disappointing, but that day I consoled myself by saying: Maybe my pickup still needs work, but my pickup lines are already in top gear, or something mildly reassuring of that sort. I also made a promise to myself: I will never be impatient and honk at a new driver if they stall. I’ll just hit reverse, overtake them, and maybe even cheer them up as I pass if that isn’t too distracting.

So the training lessons continued. Our usual route was short at first, and then it expanded to include bridges, too. That’s where the half-clutch and handbrake lessons came into practice. We even practiced reverse for a few sessions, and later I learned angular and parallel parking as well. As I write this today, I’ve gained more confidence in driving overall, though parallel parking will take some time. Until then, I’ll be parking with someone guiding me. Now my dad insists I keep practicing regularly — so yes, we do go on late-night drives frequently.

The driving test :
 You know, I've heard that if you can drive in India, you can drive anywhere in the world. I do not know whether there is actual data to back this theory up, but honestly, it could be true. The thing is, many people get their licenses without a test, but are we not putting people's safety at risk by doing so?

My test included me driving with my examiner, who was a lady police officer seated in the passenger seat. She asked me to start the car and drive in a circle bounded by orange cones on either side. That's it. Now, finally, when the licence arrives, that will mark the official completion of this side quest. I shall then go around telling people "I got my driver's license last week!" which, by the way, I’ve been dying to reference for ages:)
